In Java, the collections framework provides a set of classes and interfaces for representing and manipulating collections of objects. 

1. Collections Framework Overview:

The Java collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections.
It allows you to work with groups of objects (such as lists, sets, and maps) in a consistent and efficient manner.
The framework includes both interfaces (defining various collections) and classes (implementing those collections).
2. Common Collection Interfaces:

The following are some commonly used collection interfaces:
List: Represents an ordered collection (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList).
Set: Represents an unordered collection with no duplicate elements (e.g., HashSet, TreeSet).
Map: Represents a key-value pair collection (e.g., HashMap, TreeMap).
Queue: Represents a collection with specific ordering rules (e.g., PriorityQueue, LinkedList).
3. Common Collection Classes:

Some commonly used collection classes include:
ArrayList: A dynamic array that grows as needed.
HashSet: Stores unique elements in no particular order.
TreeMap: Stores key-value pairs sorted by keys.
LinkedList: A doubly-linked list for efficient insertions and deletions.
4. Utility Class: java.util.Collections:

The Collections class provides various static methods for working with collections.
Examples:

Collections.sort(list): Sorts a list in natural order.
Collections.reverse(list): Reverses the order of elements.
Collections.max(collection): Finds the maximum element.
