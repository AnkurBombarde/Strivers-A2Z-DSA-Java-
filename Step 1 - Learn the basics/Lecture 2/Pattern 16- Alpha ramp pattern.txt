In this pattern problem, as we can observe we have to print a right-angled pyramid just like our last pattern but with a twist. Here, in every row, we have to print the same character i times where i is the row number. For example, the 1st row will print 1 A, the 2nd row will print 2 Bâ€™s, and so on. So, similar to the previous patterns the outer loop will loop for N times and the inner loop for i times with the character value incrementing each time we enter a new row.

class Main {
   
   static void pattern16(int N)
{
     
      // Outer loop for the number of rows.
      for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
          
          
          for(int j=0;j<=i;j++){
              
              // same char which is defined 
              // is to be printed i times in that row.
              System.out.print((char)((int)('A'+i)) + " ");
              
          }
          // As soon as the letters for each iteration are printed, we move to the
          // next row and give a line break otherwise all letters
          // would get printed in 1 line.
          System.out.println();
         
      }
}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Here, we have taken the value of N as 5.
        // We can also take input from the user.
        int N = 5;
        pattern16(N);
    }
}
