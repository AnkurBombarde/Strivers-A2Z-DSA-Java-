This problem is a very simple one where we just have to print a hollow rectangle. So, after observation, we see that the stars are only printed at the border of the rectangle, and on the rest of the positions, spaces are printed. Hence, the outer loop and inner loop both will loop for n times and in the inner loop we add a condition that if the row index or column index is equal to 0 or n-1, then stars should get printed otherwise spaces should be printed.

class Main {
   
   static void pattern21(int n)
{
      // outer loop for no. of rows.
     for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
         
         // inner loop for printing the stars at borders only.
         for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
             
             if(i==0 || j==0 || i==n-1 || j==n-1)
                System.out.print("*");
                
             // if not border index, print space.
             else System.out.print(" ");
         }
         
          // As soon as the stars for each iteration are printed, we move to the
          // next row and give a line break otherwise all stars
          // would get printed in 1 line.
          System.out.println();
     }
}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Here, we have taken the value of N as 5.
        // We can also take input from the user.
        int N = 5;
        pattern21(N);
    }
}
