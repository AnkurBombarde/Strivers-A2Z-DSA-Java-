Strings:
A string is a sequence of characters (letters, digits, symbols) enclosed in double quotes (").
In Java, strings are represented by the String class.
Strings are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once created.
Common string operations include concatenation, length, substring, and comparison.

Example:


String greeting = "Hello, world!";
System.out.println("Length of the string: " + greeting.length());
System.out.println("Substring: " + greeting.substring(0, 5)); // Output is "Hello"

Arrays:
An array is a collection of elements of the same data type.
Arrays have a fixed size (defined during creation) and can hold multiple values.
Elements in an array are accessed by their index (starting from 0).
Java provides both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.

Example (One-dimensional array):


int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
System.out.println("Third element: " + numbers[2]); // Output is 30

(Multi-dimensional array - 2D):


int[][] matrix = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
System.out.println("Element at (1, 2): " + matrix[1][2]); // Output is 6
