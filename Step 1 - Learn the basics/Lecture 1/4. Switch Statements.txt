If-Else Statements:
If-else statements are like decision-making tools in programming. They allow you to choose different paths of action based on certain conditions.

Use if-else statements when:
You have complex conditions (not just simple equality checks).
You need to handle various scenarios with different code blocks.
Conditions are not easily categorized or enumerable.

Example:


if (temperature > 30) {
    System.out.println("It's hot!");
} else {
    System.out.println("It's not too hot.");
}
Switch Statements:
Switch statements are like a compact switchboard. They compare a single variable against multiple distinct values and execute specific code blocks.

Use switch statements when:
You have a single variable with specific cases (exact matches).
You want cleaner and more structured code.
Example:


switch (dayOfWeek) {
    case MONDAY:
        System.out.println("Start of the week");
        break;
    case FRIDAY:
        System.out.println("Almost weekend");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Other days");
}
