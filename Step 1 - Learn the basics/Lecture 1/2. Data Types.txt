In Java, data types define the type of values that can be stored in variables. Let’s explore some common data types along with examples:

Primitive Data Types:
These are the basic building blocks and are directly supported by the Java language.
They have fixed sizes and are stored directly in memory.
Examples:
int: Represents integer values (whole numbers). Example: int age = 25;

double: Represents floating-point numbers (decimal values). Example: double price = 19.99;

char: Represents a single character. Example: char grade = 'A';

boolean: Represents true or false values. Example: boolean isStudent = true;

Reference Data Types:
These are more complex data types that refer to objects (instances of classes).
They don’t store the actual data but hold references to memory locations where the data is stored.
Examples:
String: Represents a sequence of characters. Example: String name = "John";

Arrays: Represents a collection of elements of the same type. Example: int[] scores = {85, 90, 78};

Object: The base class for all other classes. Example: Object obj = new Object();
