Problem Statement: You are given a sorted array containing N integers and a number X, you have to find the occurrences of X in the given array.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 7,  X = 3 , array[] = {2, 2 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 4}
Output: 
4
Explanation: 3 is occurring 4 times in the given array 

Example 2:
Input:
N = 8,  X = 2 , array[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3}
Output: 
5
Explanation: 2 is occurring 5 times in the given array

Solution 1: Brute-Force approach:

The approach is simple. We will linearly search the entire array, and try to increase the counter whenever we get the target value in the array. Using a for loop that runs from 0 to n - 1, containing an if the condition that checks whether the value at that index equals target. If true then increase the counter, at last return the counter.

Code:

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static int count(int arr[], int n, int x) {
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            // counting the occurrences:
            if (arr[i] == x) cnt++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr =  {2, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 11, 13};
        int n = 8, x = 8;
        int ans = count(arr, n, x);
        System.out.println("The number of occurrences is: " + ans);
    }
}
Time Complexity: O(N), N = size of the given array
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

Solution 2:Optimal approach(Binary Search):

Algorithm:
1. We will get the first and the last occurrences of the number using the function firstAndLastPosition(). For the implementation details of the function, please refer to the previous article.
2. After getting the indices, we will check the following cases:
    a) If the first index == -1: This means that the target value is not present in the array. So, we will return 0 as the answer.
    b) Otherwise: We will find the total number of occurrences like this:
    The total number of occurrences  = (last index - first index + 1) and return this length as the answer.

Code:

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static int firstOccurrence(int[] arr, int n, int k) {
        int low = 0, high = n - 1;
        int first = -1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            // maybe an answer
            if (arr[mid] == k) {
                first = mid;
                // look for smaller index on the left
                high = mid - 1;
            } else if (arr[mid] < k) {
                low = mid + 1; // look on the right
            } else {
                high = mid - 1; // look on the left
            }
        }
        return first;
    }

    public static int lastOccurrence(int[] arr, int n, int k) {
        int low = 0, high = n - 1;
        int last = -1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            // maybe an answer
            if (arr[mid] == k) {
                last = mid;
                // look for larger index on the right
                low = mid + 1;
            } else if (arr[mid] < k) {
                low = mid + 1; // look on the right
            } else {
                high = mid - 1; // look on the left
            }
        }
        return last;
    }

    public static int[] firstAndLastPosition(int[] arr, int n, int k) {
        int first = firstOccurrence(arr, n, k);
        if (first == -1) return new int[] { -1, -1};
        int last = lastOccurrence(arr, n, k);
        return new int[] {first, last};
    }

    public static int count(int arr[], int n, int x) {
        int[] ans = firstAndLastPosition(arr, n, x);
        if (ans[0] == -1) return 0;
        return (ans[1] - ans[0] + 1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr =  {2, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 11, 13};
        int n = 8, x = 8;
        int ans = count(arr, n, x);
        System.out.println("The number of occurrences is: " + ans);
    }
