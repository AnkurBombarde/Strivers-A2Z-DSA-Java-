Assume there is a dictionary and we have to find the word “raj”.

Method 1: One of the many ways is to check every possible page of the entire dictionary and see if we can find the word “raj”. This technique is known as linear search.
Basically, we can traverse from the first till the end to find the target value in the search space i.e. the entire dictionary in our example

Method 2: In this case, we will optimize our search by using the property of a dictionary i.e. a dictionary is always in the sorted order.

    We will first try to open the dictionary in such a way that it is roughly divided into two parts. Then, we will check the left page. Now, assume the words on the left page starts with ‘s’. We can certainly say that our target word i.e. “raj” definitely comes before the words start with ‘s’. So, now, we need not search in the entire dictionary rather we will only search in the left half.

    Now, we will do the same thing with the left half. First, we will divide it into 2 halves and then try to locate which half contains the word “raj”. Eventually, after certain steps, we will end up finding the word “raj”.

Note: Binary search is only applicable in a sorted search space. The sorted search space does not necessarily have to be a sorted array. It can be anything but the search space must be sorted.

Problem statement:
You are given a sorted array of integers and a target, your task is to search for the target in the given array. Assume the given array does not contain any duplicate numbers.


Solution 1: Iterative Implimentation:

Algorithm:

Now, we will apply the binary search algorithm in the given array:

Step 1: Divide the search space into 2 halves:
In order to divide the search space, we need to find the middle point of it. So, we will take a ‘mid’ pointer and do the following:
mid = (low+high) // 2 ( ‘//’ refers to integer division)

Step 2: Compare the middle element with the target:
In this step, we can observe 3 different cases:
    a) If arr[mid] == target: We have found the target. From this step, we can return the index of the target possibly.
    b) If target > arr[mid]: This case signifies our target is located on the right half of the array. So, the next search space will be the right half.
    c) If target < arr[mid]: This case signifies our target is located on the left half of the array. So, the next search space will be the left half.

Step 3: Trim down the search space:
Based on the probable location of the target we will trim down the search space.
    a) If the target occurs on the left, we should set the high pointer to mid-1. Thus the left half will be the next search space.
    b) Similarly, if the target occurs on the right, we should set the low pointer to mid+1. Thus the right half will be the next search space.

Iterative implementation:

1. Initially, the pointers low and high will be 0 and n-1(where n = size of the given array) respectively.
2. Now inside a loop, we will perform the 3 steps discussed above in the algorithm section.
3. The loop will run until either we fount the target or any of the pointers crosses the other.

Code:

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static int binarySearch(int[] nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.length; //size of the array.
        int low = 0, high = n - 1;

        // Perform the steps:
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
            else if (target > nums[mid]) low = mid + 1;
            else high = mid - 1;
        }
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] a = {3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 16, 17};
        int target = 6;
        int ind = binarySearch(a, target);
        if (ind == -1)
            System.out.println("The target is not present.");
        else
            System.out.println("The target is at index: " + ind);
    }
} 
Time complexity: O(logN), where N=size if the given array


Solution 2:Recusive approach:

Approach:

Assume, the recursive function will look like this: binarySearch(nums, low, high). It basically takes 3 parameters i.e. the array, the low pointer, and the high pointer. In each recursive call, we will change the value of low and high pointers to trim down the search space. Except for this, the rest of the steps will be the same.

The steps are as follows:

Step 1: Divide the search space into 2 halves:
In order to divide the search space, we need to find the middle point of it. So, we will take a ‘mid’ pointer and do the following:
mid = (low+high) // 2 ( ‘//’ refers to integer division)

Step 2: Compare the middle element with the target and trim down the search space:
    a) If arr[mid] == target: We have found the target. From this step, we can return the index of the target, and the recursion will end.
    b) If target > arr[mid]: This case signifies our target is located on the right half of the array. So, the next recursion call will be binarySearch(nums, mid+1, high).
    c) If target < arr[mid]: This case signifies our target is located on the left half of the array. So, the next recursion call will be binarySearch(nums, low, mid-1).

Base case: The base case of the recursion will be low > high. If (low > high), the search space becomes invalid which means the target is not present in the array.

Code:

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static int binarySearch(int[] nums, int low, int high, int target) {
        if (low > high) return -1; //Base case.

        // Perform the steps:
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
        else if (target > nums[mid])
            return binarySearch(nums, mid + 1, high, target);
        return binarySearch(nums, low, mid - 1, target);
    }

    public static int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        return binarySearch(nums, 0, nums.length - 1, target);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] a = {3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 16, 17};
        int target = 6;
        int ind = search(a, target);
        if (ind == -1)
            System.out.println("The target is not present.");
        else
            System.out.println("The target is at index: " + ind);
    }
}
Time complexity: O(logN), where N=size of the given array.
