Problem Statement: Given a sorted array of N integers and an integer x, write a program to find the upper bound of x.

Definition: The upper bound algorithm finds the first or the smallest index in a sorted array where the value at that index is greater than the given key i.e x
The upper bound is the smallest index, ind, where add[ind]>x;

Example 1:
Input Format:
N = 4, arr[] = {1,2,2,3}, x = 2
Result:
3
Explanation: Index 3 is the smallest index such that arr[3] > x.

Example 2:
Input Format:
N = 6, arr[] = {3,5,8,9,15,19}, x = 9
Result:
4
Explanation: Index 4 is the smallest index such that arr[4] > x.

Solution:
The primary objective of the Binary Search algorithm is to efficiently determine the appropriate half to eliminate, thereby reducing the search space by half. It does this by determining a specific condition that ensures that the target is not present in that half.

Solution 1: Brute-Force approach(Using linear search):

Approach:
With the knowledge that the array is sorted, our approach involves traversing the array starting from the beginning. During this traversal, each element will be compared with the target value, x. The index, i, where the condition arr[i] > x is first satisfied, will be the answer.

Code:

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static int upperBound(int[] arr, int x, int n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > x) {
                // upper bound found:
                return i;
            }
        }
        return n;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {3, 5, 8, 9, 15, 19};
        int n = 6, x = 9;
        int ind = upperBound(arr, x, n);
        System.out.println("The upper bound is the index: " + ind);
    }
}
Time Complexity: O(N), where N = size of the given array.
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are using no extra space.

Solution 2: Optimal approach(Using Binary Search):

Approach:

As the array is sorted, we will apply the Binary Search algorithm to find the index. The steps are as follows:

We will declare the 2 pointers and an ‘ans’ variable initialized to n i.e. the size of the array(as If we don’t find any index, we will return n).

1. Place the 2 pointers i.e. low and high: Initially, we will place the pointers like this: low will point to the first index and high will point to the last index.
2. Calculate the ‘mid’: Now, we will calculate the value of mid using the following formula:
mid = (low+high) // 2 ( ‘//’ refers to integer division)
3. Compare arr[mid] with x: With comparing arr[mid] to x, we can observe 2 different cases:
    Case 1 - If arr[mid] > x: This condition means that the index mid may be an answer. So, we will update the ‘ans’ variable with mid and search in the left half if there is any smaller index that satisfies the same condition. Here, we are eliminating the right half.

    Case 2 - If arr[mid] <= x: In this case, mid cannot be our answer and we need to find some bigger element. So, we will eliminate the left half and search in the right half for the answer.

4. The above process will continue until the pointer low crosses high.

Code:

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static int upperBound(int[] arr, int x, int n) {
        int low = 0, high = n - 1;
        int ans = n;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            // maybe an answer
            if (arr[mid] > x) {
                ans = mid;
                //look for smaller index on the left
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1; // look on the right
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {3, 5, 8, 9, 15, 19};
        int n = 6, x = 9;
        int ind = upperBound(arr, x, n);
        System.out.println("The upper bound is the index: " + ind);
    }
}

Time Complexity: O(logN), where N = size of the given array.
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are using no extra space.
