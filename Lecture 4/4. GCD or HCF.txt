Problem Statement: Given two integers N1 and N2, find their greatest common divisor(GCD).

Definition: The Greatest Common Divisor(GCD) of any two integers is the largest number that divides both integers

Example 1:
Input:N1 = 9, N2 = 12
Output:3

Example 2:
Input:N1 = 20, N2 = 15
Output: 5

Algorithm:

The Euclidean Algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. It operates on the principle that the GCD of two numbers remains the same even if the smaller number is subtracted from the larger number.

To find the GCD of n1 and n2 where n1 > n2:

  Repeatedly subtract the smaller number from the larger number until one of them becomes 0.
  Once one of them becomes 0, the other number is the GCD of the original numbers.

  Code: 
                                  
public class Main {
    // Continue loop as long as both a and b are greater than 0
    public static int findGcd(int a, int b) {
        while(a > 0 && b > 0) {
            // If a is greater than b subtract b from a and update a
            if(a > b) {
                // Update a to the remainder of a divided by b
                a = a % b;
            }
            // If b is greater than or equal to a, subtract a from b and update b
            else {
                // Update b to the remainder of b divided by a
                b = b % a;
            }
        }
        // Check if a becomes 0, if so, return b as the GCD
        if(a == 0) {
            return b;
        }
        // If a is not 0, return a as the GCD
        return a;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n1 = 20, n2 = 15;

        // Find the GCD of n1 and n2
        int gcd = findGcd(n1, n2);

        System.out.println("GCD of " + n1 + " and " + n2 + " is: " + gcd);
    }
}

Approach: 

The code uses the Euclidean Algorithm to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers. This algorithm is efficient and works by repeatedly applying the modulus operation.

Key Concepts of the Euclidean Algorithm
1. Basic Principle:

The GCD of two numbers a and 𝑏(where 𝑎≥𝑏) is the same as the GCD of b and 𝑎%𝑏

This reduces the problem size with each iteration until one of the numbers becomes zero.

Algorithm Steps:

Continue the process until one of the numbers becomes zero.
The GCD is the non-zero number when the other becomes zero.
