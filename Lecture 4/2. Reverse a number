Problem Statement: Given an integer N return the reverse of the given number.


Example 1:
Input:N = 12345
Output:54321

Example 2:
Input:N = 7789
Output: 9877


import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n;
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        n = scanner.nextInt();
        int revNum = 0;
        while(n > 0){
            int ld = n % 10;
            revNum = (revNum * 10) + ld;
            n = n / 10;
        }
        System.out.println(revNum);
    }
}

Approach: 
The code uses a while loop to reverse the digits of n.
It initializes a variable revNum to store the reversed number.
The loop continues until n becomes zero (i.e., all digits are processed).

In each iteration:
Extract the last digit of n (i.e., the remainder when divided by 10) and store it in ld.
Multiply the current revNum by 10 and add the last digit (ld) to it.
Remove the last digit from n by dividing it by 10.
After the loop, revNum contains the reversed number.
