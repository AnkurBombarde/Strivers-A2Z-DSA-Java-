In this problem, we just have to print the right-angled number pyramid but here, we also have to increase the number each time we print it. For printing, the right-angled pyramid as we know the outer loop runs for N times and the inner loop runs for i times. Now, to print an increasing number pyramid we just have to increment the number inside the inner loop so that after printing the number each time it increases by 1.

class Main {
   
   static void pattern13(int N)
{
     // starting number.
     int num =1;
      
      // Outer loop for the number of rows.
      for(int i=1;i<=N;i++){
          
          // Inner loop will loop for i times and
          // print numbers increasing by 1 each time.
          for(int j=1;j<=i;j++){
              System.out.print(num + " ");
              num =num+1;
          }
          // As soon as the numbers for each iteration are printed, we move to the
          // next row and give a line break otherwise all numbers
          // would get printed in 1 line.
          System.out.println();
         
      }
}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Here, we have taken the value of N as 5.
        // We can also take input from the user.
        int N = 5;
        pattern13(N);
    }
}
