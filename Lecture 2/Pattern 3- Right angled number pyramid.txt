Approach: 

There are 4 general rules for solving a pattern-based question : 

We always use nested loops for printing the patterns. For the outer loop, we count the number of lines/rows and loop for them.
Next, for the inner loop, we focus on the number of columns and somehow connect them to the rows by forming a logic such that for each row we get the required number of columns to be printed.
We print the ‘*’ inside the inner loop.
Observe symmetry in the pattern or check if a pattern is a combination of two or more similar patterns or not.

In this pattern, we run the outer loop for N times as we have to print N rows, and since we have to print a right-angled triangle/pyramid which must be upright, so the inner loop will run for the row number in each iteration. For eg: 1 number for row 1, 5 numbers for row 5, and so on. The only difference between this pattern and pattern 2 is that here we print numbers looping from 1 to the row number for each row instead of printing stars.

Code for the above pattern: 
class Main {
   static void pattern3(int N)
{
    // This is the outer loop which will loop for the rows.
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)
    {
        // This is the inner loop which loops for the columns
       // no. of columns = row number for each line here.
       // Here, we print numbers from 1 to the row number
       // instead of stars in each row.
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++)
        {
            System.out.print(j+" ");
        }

         // As soon as numbers for each iteration are printed, we move to the
        // next row and give a line break otherwise all numbers
        // would get printed in 1 line.
        System.out.println();
    }
}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Here, we have taken the value of N as 5.
        // We can also take input from the user.
        int N = 5;
        pattern3(N);
    }
}
