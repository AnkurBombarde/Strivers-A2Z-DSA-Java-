This pattern is just a mixture of the last two patterns ( erect pyramid and inverted pyramid). Firstly, we will print the erect pyramid and then an inverted pyramid below it.

class Main {
   
   static void erect_pyramid(int N)
{
    // This is the outer loop which will loop for the rows.
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        // For printing the spaces before stars in each row
        for (int j =0; j<N-i-1; j++)
        {
            System.out.print(" ");
        }
       
        // For printing the stars in each row
        for(int j=0;j< 2*i+1;j++){
            
            System.out.print("*");
        }
        
        // For printing the spaces after the stars in each row

        // As soon as the stars for each iteration are printed, we move to the
        // next row and give a line break otherwise all stars
        // would get printed in 1 line.
        System.out.println();
    }
