In this particular pattern, we run the outer loop for N times as we have to print N rows as usual. 

As we can clearly observe that for each row there are some spaces that get printed then some stars and then again some spaces giving it a final pyramidal look. For eg: In the first row (i=0) there are 4 spaces, 1 star, then again 4 spaces. In the second row (i=1) there are 3 spaces, 3 stars, then again 3 spaces so we can say that there are N-i-1 spaces, 2*i+1 stars, and then again N-i-1 spaces for each row where i is the row index. We thus simply run 3 inner loops first for printing the spaces, then the stars, and then the spaces again.

Code for above pattern: 
class Main {
   static void pattern7(int N)
{
    // This is the outer loop which will loop for the rows.
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        // For printing the spaces before stars in each row
        for (int j =0; j<N-i-1; j++)
        {
            System.out.print(" ");
        }
       
        // For printing the stars in each row
        for(int j=0;j< 2*i+1;j++){
            
            System.out.print("*");
        }
        
        // For printing the spaces after the stars in each row
         for (int j =0; j<N-i-1; j++)
        {
            System.out.print(" ");
        }
       

        // As soon as the stars for each iteration are printed, we move to the
        // next row and give a line break otherwise all stars
        // would get printed in 1 line.
        System.out.println();
    }
}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Here, we have taken the value of N as 5.
        // We can also take input from the user.
        int N = 5;
        pattern7(N);
    }
}
