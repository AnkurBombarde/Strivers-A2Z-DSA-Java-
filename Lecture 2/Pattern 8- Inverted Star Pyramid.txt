In this particular pattern, we run the outer loop for N times as we have to print N rows as usual.
Similar to the last pattern, we can clearly observe that for each row there are some spaces that get printed then some stars, and then again some spaces giving it an inverse pyramidal look. For eg: In the first row (i=0) there are 0 spaces, 9 stars, then again 0 spaces. In the second row (i=1) there is 1 space, 7 stars, then again 1 space so we can say that there are i spaces, 2*N - (2*i+1) stars, and then again i space for each row where i is the row index. We thus simply run 3 inner loops, first for printing the spaces, then the stars, and then the spaces again.


class Main {
   static void pattern8(int N)
{
    // This is the outer loop which will loop for the rows.
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        // For printing the spaces before stars in each row
        for (int j =0; j<i; j++)
        {
            System.out.print(" ");
        }
       
        // For printing the stars in each row
        for(int j=0;j< 2*N -(2*i +1);j++){
            
            System.out.print("*");
        }
        
        // For printing the spaces after the stars in each row
        for (int j =0; j<i; j++)
        {
            System.out.print(" ");
        }
       

        // As soon as the stars for each iteration are printed, we move to the
        // next row and give a line break otherwise all stars
        // would get printed in 1 line.
        System.out.println();
    }
}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Here, we have taken the value of N as 5.
        // We can also take input from the user.
        int N = 5;
        pattern8(N);
    }
}
