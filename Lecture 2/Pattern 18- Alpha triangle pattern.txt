In this problem, we have to print an alpha triangle as shown in the examples above. We observe from the examples that each row ends with the letter E in the case when N = 5 ( ‘A’ + 4 ). Also the triangle has to be right-angled so like the previous patterns, the outer loop will run for N times and the inner loop for i times. In the inner loop, we’ll start from the letter that comes i before the (‘A’ + N -1)th letter and then run the loop till we reach (‘A’ + N-1) in every row. For example, for N = 5 in each row, the letters will be printed from ‘E’ - i to ‘E’ where i is the row index.

class Main {
   
   static void pattern18(int N)
{
       // Outer loop for the no. of rows.
       for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
          
          // Inner loop for printing the alphabets from
          // A + N -1 -i (i is row no.) to A + N -1 ( E in this case).
          for(char ch =(char)(int)('A'+N-1-i);ch<=(char)(int)('A'+N-1);ch++){
              
              System.out.print(ch + " ");
          }
          
          // As soon as the letters for each iteration are printed, we move to the
          // next row and give a line break otherwise all letters
          // would get printed in 1 line.
          System.out.println();
      }
}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Here, we have taken the value of N as 5.
        // We can also take input from the user.
        int N = 5;
        pattern18(N);
    }
}
