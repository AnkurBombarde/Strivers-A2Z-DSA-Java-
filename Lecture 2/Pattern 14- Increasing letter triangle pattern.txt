In this pattern problem, instead of numbers, we have to print alphabets hence making the pattern look like a right-angled triangle. So, the outer loop will run for N rows and the inner loop will loop for i alphabets in each row where i is the row number. Alphabets in each row will start from A each time we enter a new row and will loop till (A+i)th alphabet in that row.

class Main {
   
   static void pattern14(int N)
{
     
      // Outer loop for the number of rows.
      for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
          
          // Inner loop will loop for i times and
          // print alphabets from A to A + i.
          for(char ch = 'A'; ch<='A'+i;ch++){
              System.out.print(ch + " ");
              
          }
          // As soon as the letters for each iteration are printed, we move to the
          // next row and give a line break otherwise all letters
          // would get printed in 1 line.
          System.out.println();
         
      }
}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Here, we have taken the value of N as 5.
        // We can also take input from the user.
        int N = 5;
        pattern14(N);
    }
}
