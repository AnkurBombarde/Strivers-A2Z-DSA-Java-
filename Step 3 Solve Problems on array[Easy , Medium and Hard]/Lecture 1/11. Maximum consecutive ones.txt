Problem Statement: Given an array that contains only 1 and 0 return the count of maximum consecutive ones in the array.

Example 1:
Input: prices = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1}
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: prices = {1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1} 
Output: 2

Solution:

Approach:
We maintain a variable count that keeps a track of the number of consecutive 1’s while traversing the array. The other variable max_count maintains the maximum number of 1’s, in other words, it maintains the answer.

We start traversing from the beginning of the array. Since we can encounter either a 1 or 0 there can be two situations:-

1. If  the value at the current index is equal to 1 we increase the value of count by one. After updating  the count variable if it becomes more than the max_count  update the max_count.
2. If the value at the current index is equal to zero we make the variable count as 0 since there are no more consecutive ones.

Code:
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    static int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int nums[]) {
        int cnt = 0;
        int maxi = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 1) {
                cnt++;
            } else {
                cnt = 0;
            }

            maxi = Math.max(maxi, cnt);
        }
        return maxi;
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int nums[] = { 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1 };
        int ans = findMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums);
        System.out.println("The maximum  consecutive 1's are " + ans);
    }
}
