Problem Statement: You are given an array of ‘N’ integers. You need to find the length of the longest sequence which contains the consecutive elements.

Example 1:
Input: [100, 200, 1, 3, 2, 4]

Output: 4

Explanation: The longest consecutive subsequence is 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Example 2:
Input: [3, 8, 5, 7, 6]

Output: 4

Explanation: The longest consecutive subsequence is 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Solution 1:Brute-force approach:

Approach:
A straightforward but basic solution is to examine consecutive sequences for each element in the given array. For every element x, we will try to find the consecutive elements, x+1, x+2, x+3, and so on using the linear search algorithm. Thus, we will check the length of the longest consecutive subsequence we can build for every element x. Among all the lengths we will consider the maximum one.

Algorithm:

1. To begin, we will utilize a loop to iterate through each element one by one.
2. Next, for every element x, we will try to find the consecutive elements like x+1, x+2, x+3, and so on using the linear search algorithm in the given array.
    a) Within a loop, our objective is to locate the next consecutive element x+1. 
    b) If this element is found, we increment x by 1 and continue the search for x+2. 
    c) Furthermore, we increment the length of the current sequence (cnt) by 1. 

This process repeats until step 2.2 occurs.

1. If a specific consecutive element, for example, x+i, is not found, we will halt the search for subsequent consecutive elements such as x+i+1, x+i+2, and so on. Instead, we will take into account the length of the current sequence (cnt).
2. Among all the lengths we get for all the given array elements, the maximum one will be the answer.

Code:



import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static boolean linearSearch(int []a, int num) {
        int n = a.length; //size of array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (a[i] == num)
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    public static int longestSuccessiveElements(int []a) {
        int n = a.length; //size of array
        int longest = 1;
        //pick a element and search for its
        //consecutive numbers:
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int x = a[i];
            int cnt = 1;
            //search for consecutive numbers
            //using linear search:
            while (linearSearch(a, x + 1) == true) {
                x += 1;
                cnt += 1;
            }

            longest = Math.max(longest, cnt);
        }
        return longest;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] a = {100, 200, 1, 2, 3, 4};
        int ans = longestSuccessiveElements(a);
        System.out.println("The longest consecutive sequence is " + ans);
    }
}

Time Complexity: O(N^2), N=size of the given array.
Space Complexity: O(1).

Solution 2: Using sorting:

Approach:
1. We will consider 3 variables, 
    a) ‘lastSmaller’ →(to store the last included element of the current sequence), 
    b) ‘cnt’ → (to store the length of the current sequence), 
    c) ‘longest’ → (to store the maximum length).
2. Initialize ‘lastSmaller’ with ‘INT_MIN’, ‘cnt’ with 0, and ‘longest’ with 1(as the minimum length of the sequence is 1).

The steps are as follows:

1. First, we will sort the entire array.
2. To begin, we will utilize a loop(say i) to iterate through each element one by one.
3. For every element, we will check if this can be a part of the current sequence like the following:
    a) If arr[i]-1 == lastSmaller: The last element in our sequence is labeled as 'lastSmaller' and the current element 'arr[i]' is exactly 'lastSmaller'+1. It indicates that 'arr[i]' is the next consecutive element. To incorporate it into the sequence, we update 'lastSmaller' with the value of 'arr[i]' and increment the length of the current sequence, denoted as 'cnt', by 1.
    b) If arr[i] == lastSmaller: If the current element, arr[i], matches the last element of the sequence (represented by 'lastSmaller'), we can skip it since we have already included it before.
    c) Otherwise, if lastSmaller != arr[i]: On satisfying this condition, we can conclude that the current element, arr[i] > lastSmaller+1. It indicates that arr[i] cannot be a part of the current sequence. So, we will start a new sequence from arr[i] by updating ‘lastSmaller’ with the value of arr[i]. And we will set the length of the current sequence(cnt) to 1.
4. Every time, inside the loop, we will compare ‘cnt’ and ‘longest’ and update ‘longest’ with the maximum value. longest = max(longest, cnt)
5. Finally, once the iteration is complete, we will have the answer stored in the variable ‘longest’.

Code:



import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static int longestSuccessiveElements(int []a) {
        int n = a.length;
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        //sort the array:
        Arrays.sort(a);
        int lastSmaller = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int cnt = 0;
        int longest = 1;

        //find longest sequence:
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (a[i] - 1 == lastSmaller) {
                //a[i] is the next element of the
                //current sequence.
                cnt += 1;
                lastSmaller = a[i];
            } else if (a[i] != lastSmaller) {
                cnt = 1;
                lastSmaller = a[i];
            }
            longest = Math.max(longest, cnt);
        }
        return longest;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] a = {100, 200, 1, 2, 3, 4};
        int ans = longestSuccessiveElements(a);
        System.out.println("The longest consecutive sequence is " + ans);
    }
}

Time Complexity: O(NlogN + O(N)), where N=size of the given array.
Space Complexity: O(1).

Solution 3:Using set data structure(Optimal Approach):

Approach:
1. ‘cnt’ → (to store the length of the current sequence), 
2. ‘longest’ → (to store the maximum length).
    a)First, we will put all the array elements into the set data structure.
    b) For every element, x, that can be a starting number(i.e. x-1 does not exist in the set) we will do the following:
        1)We will set the length of the current sequence(cnt) to 1.
        2)Then, again using the set, we will search for the consecutive elements such as x+1, x+2, and so on, and find the maximum possible length of the current sequence. This length will be stored in the variable ‘cnt’.
        3) After that, we will compare ‘cnt’ and ‘longest’ and update the variable ‘longest’ with the maximum value (i.e. longest = max(longest, cnt)).
3. Finally, we will have the answer i.e. ‘longest’.

Code:



import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static int longestSuccessiveElements(int[] a) {
        int n = a.length;
        if (n == 0)
            return 0;

        int longest = 1;
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();

        // put all the array elements into set
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            set.add(a[i]);
        }

        // Find the longest sequence
        for (int it : set) {
            // if 'it' is a starting number
            if (!set.contains(it - 1)) {
                // find consecutive numbers
                int cnt = 1;
                int x = it;
                while (set.contains(x + 1)) {
                    x = x + 1;
                    cnt = cnt + 1;
                }
                longest = Math.max(longest, cnt);
            }
        }
        return longest;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] a = {100, 200, 1, 2, 3, 4};
        int ans = longestSuccessiveElements(a);
        System.out.println("The longest consecutive sequence is " + ans);
    }
}

Time Complexity: O(N) + O(2*N) ~ O(3*N), where N = size of the array.
Space Complexity: O(N).
