Problem: Print your Name N times using recursion

        Since in this problem, there is no count that can be incremented each time we call a function, how can we keep a track of how many times we have printed the name?
        For this problem, we’re going to be using a function along with parameters in which we can keep track of the number of times we’ve printed something.

        To understand this problem better, Following is the pseudocode :
void func( i, n )
{
   if(i>n) return;
 print(“Raj”);
   f( i+1,N );
}
main()
{
  int n;
  input(n);
  f(1,n);
}

Code: 
class Recursion {
    
    static void func(int i, int n){
        
            // Base Condition.
            if(i>n) return;
            System.out.println("Raj");

            // Function call to print till i increments.
            func(i+1,n);

    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {

       // Here, let’s take the value of n to be 4.
       int n = 4;
       func(1,n);
    }
}
