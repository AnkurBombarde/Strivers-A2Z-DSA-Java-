Problem Statement: Given a number X,  print its factorial. To obtain the factorial of a number , it has to be multiplied by all the whole numbers preceding it.
In other words X!=X*(X-1)*(X-2)*....*1

Example 1:
Input: X = 5
Output: 120

Example 2:
Input: X = 3
Output: 6

Solution 1: Iterative

Approach:

Since the factorial of X  will be the product of the number itself and all its preceding numbers we can run loop i, from 1 to X. In every iteration current i, is multiplied with the product so far.  

Code:

public class Main {
   static int factorial(int X) {
      int ans = 1;
      for (int i = 1; i <= X; i++) {
         ans = ans * i;
      }
      return ans;
   }
   public static void main(String[] args) {

      int X = 5;
      int result = factorial(X);
      System.out.println("The factorial of " + X + " is " + result);
   }
}

Solution 2: Recursion

The Factorial of a number N can be calculated by multiplying all the natural numbers till the number N. Through this approach, we can visualize the factorial of n natural numbers in the following way as shown below:

factorial(N) = N*factorial(N-1);

Code:

public class Main {

    // Recursive method to find the factorial of a number
    static int factorial(int n) {
        // Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
        if (n <= 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        // Recursive step: n * factorial of (n-1)
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5;  // Example number to find the factorial of
        int result = factorial(n);
        System.out.println("Factorial of " + n + " is: " + result);
    }
}
